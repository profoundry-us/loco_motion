## Current Status

**Draft** - The authors are currently drafting this document and expect to have
it completed within 1-2 weeks.

> You can choose your own statuses for your project, but typical ones would
> include `draft`, `in review`, `approved`, `rejected`, and maybe `abandoned`.
>
> We also recommend including any relevant context for the status.

## Authors / Stakeholders

 - John Author - [john@somewhere.com](mailto:john@somewhere.com)
 - Jill Stakeholder - [jill@somewhere.com](mailto:jill@somewhere.com)

> List any authors of this ADR as well as the stakeholders / decision makers.
> You can do it alphabetically, in order of contribution, standing, or random if
> you like.

## Context

> When coming to any kind of a decision, it's good to provide all parties
> involved with any context relevant to the problem at hand. That may be
> constraints based on time, resources, or technical limitations.
>
> But it is also usually helpful to discuss the reasoning behind the desire to
> come to a decision.

> - What situation led you to this point in time?
> - Why is it relevant to solve this problem **now**?
> - Who can provide additional context and in what capacity?

> All of these are things you may want to consider adding to this section.

### Constraints

> It is particularly important to make sure that you list out any relevant
> constraints for this decision / project.

> - How much time do you have to come to a decision?
> - How much time do you have to implement the decision?
> - How many resources are going to be dedicated to solving this?
> - What technologies, services, or programs should be utilized / avoided?
> - Who has the power to approve or overturn this decision?

### Resources

> Here you should list out any resources that will be valuable in helping make
> the decision.

> This could be design files, prototypes, one-pagers, brainstorming docs, Slack
> conversations, articles, conference papers, or anything else that will help
> you in the decision-making process.

> Basically, links to existing documents or references.

### Open Questions

> As you're building the draft, what questions do you have? And who can answer
> the question?
>
> It's great to keep these along with the answers to provide even more
> context to readers of the ADR.
>
> You might make a list and strike through the answered ones (`- ~Answered
> question~`), or make a task list and check them off (i.e. using `- [x]
> Question here...`).

## Proposed Solution

> This is really the meat of the ADR. That's not to say that the other sections
> are unimportant or can be skipped. But the Proposed Solution is where you go
> in-depth on the decision being made, what changes will be required, and the
> reasoning behind making this decision.
>
> This section often has many sub-sections and is usually written last after you
> have had some time to brainstorm any ideas in the section below.
>
> You can think of this as the "final write-up" or "core output" of all of this
> document.
>
> Here are some sub-sections you will likely want to fill out.

### Pros & Cons

> List out what makes this the right approach and any downsides.

### Alternative Solutions

> What other solutions have you considered and why are they not the right
> approach?

### Scaling Considerations

> What happens if you have thousands, or millions of users / records?

### Code / Database Changes / Tasks

> Provide an overview of any new classes, models, components, database changes,
> or anything else that will change how the system works.
>
> We like to build out a set of task lists (`- [x] Task one...`) under relevant
> sub-headers which describe the work to be done. For larger projects, these can
> be copy pasted into a project management system. For smaller ones, you could
> use this ADR as the project tracker.

### Rollout / Release

> Are there any special considerations about how this feature will be released?

### Consequences

> What does this mean for future decisions or code?

### Timelines / Milestones

> Depending on the type of decision, can you provide guidance on how long it
> might take to implement the solution and any key milestones you see to help
> break up the work?

## ADR Tasks

- [ ] Initial brainstorming session
- [ ] Draft the core of the ADR
- [ ] Refine various sections
- [ ] Submit for review
- [ ] If approved / necessary, create tickets
- [ ] Review / update after finishing the solution with any new context /
      learnings

## Brainstorming

> This section is generally very free-form and is used as the starting point to
> get your ideas onto paper.
>
> As you are having discussions, just take some notes here and then move them
> into the proper sections when appropriate.
