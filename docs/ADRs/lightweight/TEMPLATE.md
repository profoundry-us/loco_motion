# Descriptive Title About the Lightweight Decision to be Made

> Underneath the title, you should have a short sentence or two describing the
> decision that needs to be made.

> Lightweight ADRs should be fast to create and easy to make a decision.
> Although you can include any sections from the Foundational ADR Template that
> you feel are relevant, you can also feel free to skip any that you feel are
> irrelevant.
>
> That said, it's still usually useful to include the current status, authors,
> context and maybe constraints.
>
> The real difference usually comes in a slimmed down Proposed Solution section.

## Current Status

**Draft** - The authors are currently drafting this document and expect to have
it completed within 1-2 weeks.

> You can choose your own statuses for your project, but typical ones would
> include `draft`, `in review`, `approved`, `rejected`, and maybe `abandoned`.
>
> We also recommend including any relevant context for the status.

## Authors / Stakeholders

 - John Author - [john@somewhere.com](mailto:john@somewhere.com)
 - Jill Stakeholder - [jill@somewhere.com](mailto:jill@somewhere.com)

> List any authors of this ADR as well as the stakeholders / decision makers.
> You can do it alphabetically, in order of contribution, standing, or random if
> you like.

## Context

> When coming to any kind of a decision, it's good to provide all parties
> involved with any context relevant to the problem at hand. That may be
> constraints based on time, resources, or technical limitations.
>
> But it is also usually helpful to discuss the reasoning behind the desire to
> come to a decision.
>
> - What situation led you to this point in time?
> - Why is it relevant to solve this problem **now**?
> - Who can provide additional context and in what capacity?
>
> All of these are things you may want to consider adding to this section.

### Constraints

> It is particularly important to make sure that you list out any relevant
> constraints for this decision / project.
>
> - How much time do you have to come to a decision?
> - How much time do you have to implement the decision?
> - How many resources are going to be dedicated to solving this?
> - What technologies, services, or programs should be utilized / avoided?
> - Who has the power to approve or overturn this decision?

### Resources

> Here you should list out any resources that will be valuable in helping make
> the decision.
>
> This could be design files, prototypes, one-pagers, brainstorming docs, Slack
> conversations, articles, conference papers, or anything else that will help
> you in the decision-making process.
>
> Basically, links to existing documents or references.

### Open Questions

> As you're building the draft, what questions do you have? And who can answer
> the question?
>
> It's great to keep these along with the answers to provide even more
> context to readers of the ADR.
>
> You might make a list and strike through the answered ones (`- ~Answered
> question~`), or make a task list and check them off (i.e. using `- [x]
> Question here...`).

## Proposed Solution

> Typically, the Proposed Solution section of a Lightweight ADR will have much
> less detail than a Foundational ADR. This is where the "lightweight" part
> comes in as you generally won't list out the various code changes you intend,
> and you may skip alternate solutions, scaling considerations, rollout /
> release and other irrelevant sections.

## ADR Tasks

- [ ] Initial brainstorming session
- [ ] Draft the core of the ADR
- [ ] Refine various sections
- [ ] Submit for review
- [ ] If approved / necessary, create tickets
- [ ] Review / update after finishing the solution with any new context /
      learnings

## Brainstorming

> This section is generally very free-form and is used as the starting point to
> get your ideas onto paper.
>
> As you are having discussions, just take some notes here and then move them
> into the proper sections when appropriate.
