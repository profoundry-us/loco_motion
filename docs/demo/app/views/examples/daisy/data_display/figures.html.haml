    Image containers with optional captions for visual content presentation.
    Perfect for displaying photos, illustrations, or graphics with descriptive
    text in articles, galleries, and documentation.

    %p
      Figures are used to display images with optional captions. They are commonly
      used within cards and other content containers. By default, images appear
      above the content.

  = daisy_figure(css: "max-w-96", src: image_path("landscapes/beach.jpg"))


= doc_example(title: "Figure with Caption") do |doc|
  - doc.with_description do
    :markdown
      You can add a caption to your figure by providing content to the component.
      The image appears above the caption by default (`position: "top"`).

  = daisy_figure(css: "max-w-96", src: image_path("landscapes/mountain-river.jpg")) do
    %p.text-center.italic A beautiful mountain river landscape


= doc_example(title: "Figure with Bottom Position") do |doc|
  - doc.with_description do
    :markdown
      Use `position: "bottom"` to display the caption above the image. This is
      useful when you want the text to appear first in the reading flow.

  = daisy_figure(css: "max-w-96", src: image_path("landscapes/forest.jpg"), position: "bottom") do
    %p.text-center.italic A serene forest pathway


= doc_example(title: "Custom Content") do |doc|
  - doc.with_description do
    %p
      Figures can also be used without an image to display custom content.

  = daisy_figure(css: "max-w-96 bg-base-100 border border-base-300 p-4 rounded-lg") do
    .flex.flex-col.items-center.gap-4
      = hero_icon("photo", css: "size-16 text-base-content/50")
      %p.text-center.italic Custom content without an image
