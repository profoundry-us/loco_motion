    Radial progress bars are used to indicate the progress of a process, in a
    circular fasion.

      Radial progress bars utilize a `value` attribute to set the progress and
      can have various colors / sizes, along with content inside.

      The max is always set to 100 due to the way they are rendered, so `value`
      should always be a percentage of the bar that is filled.
