    Radial progress bars are used to indicate the progress of a process, in a
    circular fasion.


= doc_example(title: "Basic Radials") do |doc|
  - doc.with_description do
    :markdown
      Radial progress bars utilize a `value` attribute to set the progress and
      can have various colors / sizes, along with content inside.

      The max is always set to 100 due to the way they are rendered, so `value`
      should always be a percentage of the bar that is filled.

    66%

      The content doesn't have to be just text!

  = daisy_radial(value: 68) do
    = hero_icon("beaker", css: "size-8 text-primary")

  = daisy_radial(value: 52, css: "text-success") do
    52%

  = daisy_radial(value: 13, css: "text-error text-3xl") do

      You can also control the size, thickness, and color of the radial
      progress.

      - `size` defaults to `5rem` and **must** include units
      - `thickness` defaults to `calc(size / 10)` and **must** include units

  = daisy_radial(value: 19, size: "15rem", thickness: "4px",
    css: "bg-primary text-primary-content text-3xl border-accent border-8") do
    19%
