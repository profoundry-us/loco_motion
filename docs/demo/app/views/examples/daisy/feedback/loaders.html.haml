        This component's helper method is also aliased as `daisy_loader`
        because we think it sounds better ðŸ˜„

        However, you **must** use the `loading` class names for the CSS to work
        properly.

  = daisy_loading(css: "loading-spinner text-primary")
  = daisy_loading(css: "loading-dots text-secondary")
  = daisy_loading(css: "loading-ring text-accent")
  = daisy_loader(css: "loading-ball text-info")
  = daisy_loader(css: "loading-bars text-success")
  = daisy_loader(css: "loading-infinity text-error")
