    Tailwind removes the styling on standard links so we provide an easy way to
    re-add them. This works very similarly to the
    = link_to "link_to", "https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to", class: "font-mono"
    helper in Rails.


= doc_example(title: "Basic Links") do |doc|
  - doc.with_description do
    :markdown
      Basic links are styled with the `.link` class. The `title` and `href`
      options can be passed as keyword arguments, or as the first two positional
      arguments.

      The `title` can also be passed as a block.
