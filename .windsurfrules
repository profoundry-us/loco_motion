# Cascade AI Windsurf Rules

This file outlines the rules and guidelines for the Cascade AI assistant when
working on the LocoMotion project.

The rules are broken down into specific sections for clarity and
maintainability. Please refer to the individual rule files located in the
`.windsurf/rules/` directory (or other guides within the project) for details on
each topic:

*   [Maintaining Rules](./.windsurf/rules/maintaining_rules.md)
*   [Communication](./.windsurf/rules/communication.md)
*   [Planning](./.windsurf/rules/planning.md)
*   [Coding](./.windsurf/rules/coding.md)
*   [Component Implementation](./.windsurf/rules/component_implementation.md)
*   [Committing](./.windsurf/rules/committing.md)
*   [Creating a Pull Request](./.windsurf/rules/creating_a_pull_request.md)
*   [Documenting Code](./.windsurf/rules/documenting_code.md)
*   [Non-Code Documentation](./.windsurf/rules/non_code_documentation.md)
*   [Creating Guides](./.windsurf/rules/creating_guides.md)
*   [Updating the CHANGELOG](./.windsurf/rules/updating_the_changelog.md)
*   [Releasing](./.windsurf/rules/releasing.md)
*   [Running Commands](./.windsurf/rules/running_commands.md)

These rules help ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to project standards
during AI-assisted development.

# Always-On Rules

0. NEVER push to the remote repository unless explicitly told to do so
1. NEVER try to start / stop Docker containers; prompt the user for help instead
2. ALWAYS review the `Makefile` before running any commands
3. ALWAYS use `/bin/rm`, `/bin/mv`, and `/bin/cp` commands instead of `rm`, `mv`, and `cp` (which have aliases that prompt for confirmation)
