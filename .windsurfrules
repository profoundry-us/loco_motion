<documentation>

0. We utilize YARD to generate our documentation.
1. When documenting new components,utilize existing components as a guide.
2. If a component uses `define_part` or `define_parts`, use the `@part` macro to document it.
3. If a component uses `renders_one` or `renders_many`, use the `@slot` macro to document it.
4. If a component uses `renders_many`, use the `+` symbol after the name to indicate that it allows multiple calls.
5. When documenting a component, we use `@param` only for positional arguments and `@option` for all other keyword arguments.
6. All loco_examples in the YARD documentation should use proper HAML syntax.
7. When adding a TODO item, it should be appended to the bottom of the list in the README.md file.

<coding>

1. When writing new code, follow the conventions of existing code such as components.
2. When writing docs, follow the conventions of existing docs such as the Button component.
3. When writing tests, follow the conventions of existing tests such as the `button_component_spec.rb`.
4. All code should be tested and have proper documentation.
5. Assume that you are a mid-level software engineer when creating new code.
6. Follow the principles of KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple).
7. Follow the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
8. Remember that we run everything with Docker, so some commands may need to change.
9. Utilize the Makefile as a resource when learning how to run commands.
10. After making a change, re-run all tests to ensure they remain passing.
11. When writing documentation or tests, reference the files in `docs/demo/app/views/examples` as a usage guide.
12. Part customizations such as `resizer_css` or `header_html` are handled by the parent class and do NOT need special code in the child components.

<committing>

1. When committing code, follow these steps:
  a. Run a `git status --porcelain` to see what files changed.
  b. Run `git add .` to add all changed files to the index.
  c. Run `git diff` on all of the modified files to see what has changed.
  d. Iterate over every modified file and generate a brief description of the changes for that file.
  e. Compile all changes into a singular commit message utilizing Markdown headers, lists, and code blocks.
  f. Commit the changes.

2. When providing links for Pull Requests, ensure I can click on the link.
