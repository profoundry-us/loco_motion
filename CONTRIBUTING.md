# Getting Started

Not much to put here yet, but want to remember that we use the VSCode plugin
[Markdown All In One][1] for keeping our Table of Contents up-to-date in any
markdown files (like the `README.md` or this one).

> [!CAUTION]
> You MUST generate a ToC first or it won't even attempt to auto update it.
