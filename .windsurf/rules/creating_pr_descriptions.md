# Creating PR Descriptions

When asked to create a PR description, follow these proceedures.

1. MUST utilize existing template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

2. MUST run `git log --oneline main..HEAD` to see a comprehensive list of all changes.

3. MUST include relevant lines for every commit in the branch.

4. MUST format the PR using Markdown.

5. MUST provide a code snippet that I can easily copy / paste into GitHub.
