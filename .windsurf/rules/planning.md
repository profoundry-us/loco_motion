# Planning

When asked to create a plan, follow these proceedures.

1. MUST review the relevant template in the `docs/plans/templates` directory.

2. MUST create a Markdown file in the `docs/plans` directory.

3. MUST utilize existing plans as a guide for building new plans.

4. MUST include exact links provided by the user.

5. NEVER add component variants unless explicitly requested.

6. MUST pause after creating the plan so user can review.
