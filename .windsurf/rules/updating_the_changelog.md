# Updating the CHANGELOG

When modifying the `CHANGELOG.md` file, follow these procedures regarding format:

1. MUST review the existing `CHANGELOG.md` content to ensure consistency with
   the established format.

2. MUST ensure new entries are added as list items under the correct section
   header (`[Unreleased]` or a specific version header like
   `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`).

3. MUST maintain the link reference definitions at the bottom of the file when
   adding new version sections.

4. NEVER alter existing changelog entries unless explicitly asked.
