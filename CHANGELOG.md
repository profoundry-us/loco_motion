# Changelog

All notable changes to LocoMotion will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project _mostly_ adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

We say mostly because all versions before 1.0.0 will likely have breaking
changes as we don't consider the project "released" until that point in time.

We plan to use patch versions only for bug fixes, and for now, all minor
releases should be considered breaking!

## [0.4.0] - 2025-03-07

This version is a major milestone as it finishes out a basic version of all of
the DaisyUI 4 components!

While this gives us a solid foundation to start using the components, we feel
that our time will best be spent upgrading the configuration and components to
utilize the new DaisyUI 5 framework that was recently released.

We will be migrating to the new version and all bug fixes / improvements will be
made in a new LocoMotion 0.5.0 branch / release.
